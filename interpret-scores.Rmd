## Objectives and Resources

This chapter will focus on the conceptual framework of the Ocean Health Index. We will interpret the goals assessed and the scores for the global assessments, and discuss whether all the goals are relevant for the specific country.

## Goals Assessed

**Global Ocean Health Index assessments score 10 goals, some of which have sub-goals**. 

The Ocean Health Index measures the ability of oceans to sustainably provide 10 products or services (called "goals") that are important to humans. Here you will find a description of the goals used in global assessments. Goal-by-goal, you can explore the data used to model status and trend, as well as the pressures and resilience measures contributing to goal scores.

## Goal Philosophies

presentation

## Calculating scores

**Goal scores are calculated by modeling data first as Present Status and Likely Future State.**  

Likely Future State is a combination of status, trend, pressures and resilience calculations, which unequally contribute to goal scores.

## Discussion: Are all goals relevant for your country?

Let's start off by looking at which goals are scored for your country. Go to [oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores) and type in your country of interest, for example: [Samoa](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores/scores/samoa).

Are any goals not assessed (showing up as a grey petal because there was no score calculated ["NA"])

Another way to look at this is on [ohi-science.org/ohi-global](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global): this is a slightly different display because it shows the sub-goals of each goal as separate petals instead of combined.
