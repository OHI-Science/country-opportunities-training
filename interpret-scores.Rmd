## Objectives and Resources

This chapter will focus on the conceptual framework of the Ocean Health Index. We will interpret the goals assessed and the scores for the global assessments, and discuss whether all the goals are relevant for the specific country.

## Goals Assessed

**Global Ocean Health Index assessments score 10 goals, some of which have sub-goals**. 

The Ocean Health Index measures the ability of oceans to sustainably provide 10 products or services (called "goals") that are important to humans. Here you will find a description of the goals used in global assessments. Goal-by-goal, you can explore the data used to model status and trend, as well as the pressures and resilience measures contributing to goal scores.

### Goal Philosophies

### Calculating scores

**Goal scores are calculated by modeling data first as Present Status and Likely Future State.**  
Likely Future State is a combination of status, trend, pressures and resilience calculations, which unequally contribute to goal scores.

## Discussion: Are all goals relevant here?

Let's start off by looking at [oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores) and typing in the country of interest, for example: [Samoa](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores/scores/samoa).

- are any goals not assessed (NA)?
- what do their scores mean?

## Discussion: Are all resilience measures relevant here?
