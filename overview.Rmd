The Ocean Health Index has two main websites – [oceanhealthindex.org](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org) and [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org/) – each with their own purpose. As a general rule of thumb, [oceanhealthindex.org](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org) gives an overview of OHI, while (ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org/) provides a technical perspective of OHI and insights into the open data science that supports the creation of OHI scores.
