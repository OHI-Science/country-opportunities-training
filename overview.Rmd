Welcome. 

<!--- Country Opportunities workshops ... Two Tiers...--->

In this workshop we will take an in-depth look at OHI Global Assessments. We will focus on what is included in global assessments, both conceptually and concretely by looking at data. 

A main objective of this workshop is to explore how scores from global assessments represent a specific country. This will allow us to identify opportunities for a country, both in terms of management action based on the seven years of global scores, and in terms of planning for further OHI+ assessments. 

## Country Opportunities and OHI+

This is a Countries Opportunity Workshop â€” Tier 1. This means we'll acheive X,Y,Z. By the end of the workshop we'll have ideas for how you could make recommendations for management, or have a plan for Tier 2 or OHI+. 


## What to Expect

In this workshop we will discuss both the OHI Framework and the OHI Toolbox, focusing on the tailored parts and how they represent your country.

We will discuss the following questions. 

For the OHI Framework: 

1. "How do the goals included in global assessments represent your country?" We will discuss whether the philosophies behind the goals represent what is important to your country.

Then, on a more technical level through the OHI Toolbox: 

1. "Does the goal model represent the philosophy of this goal for your country?" We will discuss the global datasets that were available and how the data were modeled
2. "Does the available data represent your country?" We will explore whether the data for your country was reported or whether this information was gapfilled
