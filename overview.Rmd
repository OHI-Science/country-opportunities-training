## Objectives and Resources

**Objectives**

**Resources**

The Ocean Health Index has two main websites – [oceanhealthindex.org](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org) and [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org/) – each with their own purpose. As a general rule of thumb, [oceanhealthindex.org](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org) gives an overview of OHI, while [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org/) provides a technical perspective of OHI and insights into the open data science that supports the creation of OHI scores.

## Countries and Territories Assessed 

The best place to get a sense of the countries assessed in global OHI assessments is [oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores/)

## Repeated Annually Since 2012

## Open Science and Data Science

## OHI+

- 3 tiers: country opportunities, tailor global, tailor OHI+
