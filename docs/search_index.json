All the information we cover is available online; this book is a resource to everything we cover, as are the links within. How to use this book This book is a guide to interpreting and exploring global assessments for a specific country or territory (of the 220 coastal countries/territories that are scored). The book is written to help guide this interpretation and exporation, and will have specific countries as examples. Each chapter will have the same structure, starting with the Objectives and Resources for the chapter, and ending with examples for a specific country or territory. "],

There are actually many levels to answering this. There are over 100 data sources that are used to calculate global assessments, and these are the data we most easily report. However, the data available for each of the 220 countries and territories varies within these data sources. Here we will begin to explore those data. 4.1.1 Objectives explore data sources for global assessments explore data for a specific country discuss gapfilling data 4.1.2 Resources http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/layers_table.html (Mapping Uncertainty Due to Missing Data)[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0160377) 4.2 Data sources for global assessments status/trend pressures/resilience 4.3 Data for a specific country Habitats Fisheries Iconic Species 4.4 Gapfilling data carpet plots 4.5 Country examples 4.5.1 Samoa "]
