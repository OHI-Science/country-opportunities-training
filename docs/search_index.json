["index.html", "OHI Country Opportunities Chapter 1 Welcome", " OHI Country Opportunities The Ocean Health Index Team 2018-04-26 Chapter 1 Welcome – This book is under active development – This training book will help you interpret Ocean Health Index global assessments and discover opportunities at a country scale. This book covers global assessments conceptually with the OHI framework, and technically with the data included in the global assessment. Discussion will be country-specific: how the information included in the OHI global assessment represents your country. By the end of the workshop, we will demonstrate how OHI scores can be recalculated for your country based on input from the workshop discussions. Additionally, we will discuss a plan for further tailoring so that OHI scores better represent your country. All the information we cover is available online; this book is a resource to everything we cover, as are the links within. How to use this book This book is a guide to interpreting and exploring global assessments for a specific country or territory (of the 220 coastal countries/territories that are scored). The book is written to help guide this interpretation and exporation, and will have specific countries as examples. Each chapter will have the same structure, starting with the Objectives and Resources for the chapter, and ending with examples for a specific country or territory. "],

Objectives There will be a presentation covering the following: What the OHI framework is, and why it is important The OHI repeatable assessment process The OHI Program “Umbrella”: OHI global assessments, repeated annually since 2012 OHI+ Science, data science, and open science Community of practice Support materials on ohi-science.org Resources The Ocean Health Index has two main websites – oceanhealthindex.org and ohi-science.org – each with their own purpose. As a general rule of thumb, oceanhealthindex.org gives an overview of OHI, while ohi-science.org provides a technical perspective of OHI and insights into the open data science that supports the creation of OHI scores. http://ohi-science.org/ http://www.oceanhealthindex.org 2.2 Ocean Health Index Program Overview link to a shortened version of this presentation 2.3 Countries and Territories Assessed Global OHI assessments score 220 coastal countries and territories. The best place to get a sense of the countries assessed in global OHI assessments is exploring interactively at oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores. 2.4 Interpreting scores All reported scores are between 0-100, with 0 being the lowest and 100 being the highest. OHI scores represent how well coastal nations and territories deliver a suite of ocean-derived benefits to humans, on a scale of 0-100. Scores are represented in flower plots, where each petal represents an OHI goal or sub-goal. The center number is the region’s overall Index score. Let’s have a look at the Global average for 2017: The petal length and color convey the score of the goal, where longer, dark blue petals are closer to achieving their target. The width of the petals represents their weighting, where all goals are equally weighted but sub-goals vary. Now that we know all the flower plot components, what insights can we gain? Here the Index score is 70/100, highlighting room for improvement to achieve a healthy, sustainably managed ocean. Species &amp; habitats scored the highest, and mariculture &amp; fisheries scored the lowest. "],

We will interpret the goals assessed and the scores for the global assessments, and discuss whether all the goals are relevant for the specific country. Objectives Resources http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals http://ohi-science.org/goals/ http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores 3.2 Goals Assessed Global Ocean Health Index assessments score 10 goals, some of which have sub-goals. The Ocean Health Index measures the ability of oceans to sustainably provide 10 products or services (called “goals”) that are important to humans. Here you will find a description of the goals used in global assessments. Goal-by-goal, you can explore the data used to model status and trend, as well as the pressures and resilience measures contributing to goal scores. 3.3 Goal Philosophies presentation 3.4 Calculating scores Goal scores are calculated by modeling data first as Present Status and Likely Future State. Likely Future State is a combination of status, trend, pressures and resilience calculations, which unequally contribute to goal scores. 3.4.1 Reference points Reference points exist 3.4.2 Pressures and Resilience measures exist 3.5 Discussion: Are all goals relevant for your country? Let’s start off by looking at which goals are scored for your country. Go to oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores and type in your country of interest, for example: Samoa. Are any goals not assessed (showing up as a grey petal because there was no score calculated [“NA”]) Another way to look at this is on ohi-science.org/ohi-global: this is a slightly different display because it shows the sub-goals of each goal as separate petals instead of combined. 3.6 Discussion: Are all resilience measures relevant for your country?

There are actually many levels to answering this. There are over 100 data sources that are used to calculate global assessments, and these are the data we most easily report. However, the data available for each of the 220 countries and territories varies within these data sources. Here we will begin to explore those data. Objectives explore data sources for global assessments explore data for a specific country discuss gapfilling data Resources http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/layers_table.html (Mapping Uncertainty Due to Missing Data)[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0160377) 4.2 Goal Models and Data Sources More information on each goal in the global assessment: ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals status/trend pressures/resilience 4.3 Data for a specific country When data layers have sub-categories of information within them, such as habitat type, only the the sub-categories that are relevant to a specific region will be included. For example, both Samoa and Canada have data layers about habitat, but Samoa has… Habitats Fisheries Iconic Species 4.4 Gapfilling Data: Global Assessments 4.4.1 Methods For priority setting. Intro of gapfilling Mel’s paper (not LE) Mel’s presentation 4.4.2 Results The results for 220 countries in 2015. From Frazier et al: Regions varied greatly in the contribution of gapfilled data to their overall index scores. Regions with larger amounts of gapfilled data tended to be smaller and/or territorial jurisdictions of countries, highlighting the fact that most territories and smaller countries (often with smaller economies and other resources) tend to be monitored and assessed less frequently. Figure 2a For the regions, the contribution of gapfilled data to their index scores ranged from 0 to 64%. For many regions, index scores were calculated using relatively little gapfilled data: 27 regions (of 220) had 5% gapfilled data, and 56 regions had 10%. … In general, the contribution of gapfilled data to index scores was fairly high for Islands in the South Pacific.
