["index.html", "OHI Country Opportunities Chapter 1 Welcome", " OHI Country Opportunities The Ocean Health Index Team 2018-04-26 Chapter 1 Welcome – This book is under active development – This training book will help you interpret Ocean Health Index global assessments and discover opportunities at a country scale. This book covers global assessments conceptually with the OHI framework, and technically with the data included in the global assessment. Discussion will be country-specific: how the information included in the OHI global assessment represents your country. By the end of the workshop, we will demonstrate how OHI scores can be recalculated for your country based on input from the workshop discussions. Additionally, we will discuss a plan for further tailoring so that OHI scores better represent your country. All the information we cover is available online; this book is a resource to everything we cover, as are the links within. How to use this book This book is a guide to interpreting and exploring global assessments for a specific country or territory (of the 220 coastal countries/territories that are scored). The book is written to help guide this interpretation and exporation, and will have specific countries as examples. Each chapter will have the same structure, starting with the Objectives and Resources for the chapter, and ending with examples for a specific country or territory. "],

As a general rule of thumb, oceanhealthindex.org gives an overview of OHI, while ohi-science.org provides a technical perspective of OHI and insights into the open data science that supports the creation of OHI scores. http://ohi-science.org/ http://www.oceanhealthindex.org 2.2 Consider This: link to a shortened version of this presentation 2.3 Countries and Territories Assessed The best place to get a sense of the countries assessed in global OHI assessments is oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores 2.4 Repeated Annually Since 2012 2.5 Open Science and Data Science 2.6 OHI+ 3 tiers: country opportunities, tailor global, tailor OHI+ 2.7 OHI Process "],

We will interpret the goals assessed and the scores for the global assessments, and discuss whether all the goals are relevant for the specific country. Objectives Resources http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals http://ohi-science.org/goals/ http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores 3.2 Goals Assessed Global Ocean Health Index assessments score 10 goals, some of which have sub-goals. The Ocean Health Index measures the ability of oceans to sustainably provide 10 products or services (called “goals”) that are important to humans. Here you will find a description of the goals used in global assessments. Goal-by-goal, you can explore the data used to model status and trend, as well as the pressures and resilience measures contributing to goal scores. 3.2.1 Goal Philosophies presentation 3.2.2 Calculating scores Goal scores are calculated by modeling data first as Present Status and Likely Future State. Likely Future State is a combination of status, trend, pressures and resilience calculations, which unequally contribute to goal scores. first mention of global data/ref points (will go deeper) first mention pressure/resilience measures (will go deeper) 3.2.3 Goal Models and Data More information on each goal in the global assessment: ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals 3.3 Scores and Flowerplots Interpreting scores (with global average) 1-100 flower plots 3.4 Discussion: Are all goals relevant here? Let’s start off by looking at oceanhealthindex.org/region-scores and typing in the country of interest, for example: Samoa. are any goals not assessed (NA)? what do their scores mean? 3.5 Discussion: Are all resilience measures relevant here?

There are actually many levels to answering this. There are over 100 data sources that are used to calculate global assessments, and these are the data we most easily report. However, the data available for each of the 220 countries and territories varies within these data sources. Here we will begin to explore those data.
